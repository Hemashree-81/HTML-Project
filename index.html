    Welcome to my Panda family!

    <h1>Panda</h1>
    <p>The giant panda<b>(Ailuropoda melanoleuca), also known as the panda bear or simply panda,is a bear species endemic to China</b>. It is characterised by its<i>white coat with black patches around the eyes, ears, legs and shoulders.</i> Its body is rotund; adult individuals weigh 100 to 115 kg (220 to 254 lb) and are typically 1.2 to 1.9 m (3 ft 11 in to 6 ft 3 in) long</p>
    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>The word panda was borrowed into <u>English from French</u>, but no conclusive explanation of the origin of the French word panda has been found.<hr>The closest candidate is the <u>Nepali word ponya</u>, possibly referring to the adapted wrist bone of the red panda, which is native to Nepal.</p>
    <h2>Distribution and habitat</h2>
    <p>The giant panda is <u>endemic to China.</u> It is found in <i>small, fragmented populations in six mountainous regions in the country, mainly in<b>Sichuan, and also in neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu</b>.</i>Successful habitat preservation has seen a rise in panda numbers, though loss of habitat due to human activities remains its biggest threat. In areas with a high concentration of medium-to-large-sized mammals—such as domestic cattle, a species known to degrade the landscape—the giant panda population is generally low. This is mainly attributed to the panda's avoidance of interspecific competition.</p>
    <h2>Ecology</h2> 
    <center><img src="./images (2).jfif">
    <p>The morphological characteristics of extinct relatives of the giant panda suggest that while the <u>ancient giant panda was omnivorous 7 million years ago (mya)</u>, it only became herbivorous some 2–2.4 mya with the emergence of A. microta.Genome sequencing of the giant panda suggests that the dietary switch could have initiated from the loss of the sole umami taste receptor, encoded by the genes<b>TAS1R1 and TAS1R3 (also known as T1R1 and T1R3),</b> resulting from two frameshift mutations within the T1R1 exons.</p>
    <h2>Interspecific interactions</h2>
    <p>Giant pandas are sympatric with other large mammals and bamboo feeders, such as the takin <i>(Budorcas taxicolor)</i>. The takin and giant panda share a similar ecological niche, and they consume the same resources. When competition for food is fierce, pandas disperse to the outskirts of takin distribution. Other possible competitors include but is not limited to, the Eurasian wild pig <b>(Sus scrofa), Chinese goral (Naemorhedus griseus)</b> and the <i>Asian black bear (Ursus thibetanus).</i></p>
    <h2>Pathogens and parasites</h2>
    <p>A captive female died from toxoplasmosis, a disease caused by an obligate intracellular parasitic protozoan known as <b>Toxoplasma gondii </b>that infects most warm-blooded animals, including humans.They are likely susceptible to diseases from <i>Baylisascaris schroederi</i>, a parasitic nematode known to infect giant panda intestines. This nematode species is known to give pandas <i>baylisascariasis</i>, a deadly disease that kills more wild pandas than any other cause.Additionally, the population is threatened by<i> canine distemper virus (CDV), canine parvovirus, rotavirus, canine adenovirus, and canine coronavirus</i>. Bacteria, such as <b>Clostridium welchii, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli</b>, may also be lethal.</p>

    <p>Lorem,<b>Pandas can assess an individual's dominance status,<i>including their age and size,</i> via odor cues and may choose to avoid a scent mark</b> if the signaler's competitive ability outweighs their own.</p>
